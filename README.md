`The Read Me file describes the program, software, and files for your project. `
`To make changes to the original repository create a branch from Main and 'Commit' it to make the changes. Then 'pull' it or do a pull request to collaborate to propose your changes, requesting a review, pull in your contribution to merge them in their branch. Pull requests shows differences or diffs of the content from both of the branches and you'll notice that additions, changes, subtraction are displayed in different colors. So go ahead, make a change to an original repository, submit a 'commit' then open a pull request to start your discussion before the code is finished. You can use the @mention while doing your pull request to ask for feedback from a particular person or teams even if they're in your building or many time zones away. To learn the GithUB FLOW go ahead and open a pull request from your own repository and merge them for yourself.`
